- Progression: Landing → Sign Up → Email Verification → Dashboard → Project Creation
- Success criteria: Users can securely access their projects across sessions

**Hybrid Visual/Code Editor**
- Functionality: Toggle between drag-drop visual builder and Monaco code editor with real-time sync
- Purpose: Serve both designers and developers without compromising either workflow
- Trigger: User creates new project or opens existing project
- Progression: Project Selection → Editor Load → Visual/Code Toggle → Real-time Preview → Save
- Success criteria: Changes in visual editor immediately reflect in code and vice versa

**Template Gallery & Project Creation**
- Functionality: Curated collection of responsive templates across categories (landing, portfolio, blog)
- Purpose: Accelerate project start and showcase platform capabilities
- Trigger: User clicks "New Project" from dashboard
- Progression: New Project → Template Gallery → Category Filter → Preview → Apply → Editor
- Success criteria: Users can create professional sites in under 30 minutes

**One-Click Deploy System**
- Functionality: Deploy projects to live URLs with automatic SSL and custom domain support

- Success criteria: 99% deploy success rate with sites live in under 2 minutes

**Project Dashboard**
- Functionality: Overview of all projects with status, analytics, and quick actions
- Purpose: Central hub for managing multiple projects efficiently
- Trigger: User logs into platform
- Progression: Login → Dashboard → Project Grid → Quick Actions (Edit/Deploy/Delete)
- Success criteria: Users can manage 10+ projects efficiently with clear status indicators

## Edge Case Handling

**Connection Loss**: Auto-save drafts locally with sync restoration when connection returns
**Large Projects**: Implement lazy loading and virtualization to maintain editor performance
**Browser Compatibility**: Progressive enhancement with graceful degradation for older browsers
**Deploy Failures**: Detailed error logging with actionable troubleshooting steps
**Template Conflicts**: Smart merge resolution when applying templates to existing projects

## Design Direction

The design should feel cutting-edge yet approachable, balancing the sophistication developers expect with the simplicity designers need. Clean, minimal interface that gets out of the way but rich with contextual tools when needed.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using a sophisticated blue-orange palette that communicates both technical reliability and creative energy, perfect for bridging developer and designer audiences.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Professional Blue (oklch(0.4 0.15 240)) - Communicates trust, professionalism, and technical competence
- **Secondary Colors**: Muted grays and whites for interface elements and content areas
- **Accent Color**: Energetic Orange (oklch(0.65 0.2 40)) - Highlights calls-to-action and creative tools
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background White (oklch(1 0 0)): Charcoal text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 16.1:1 ✓
  - Primary Blue (oklch(0.4 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent Orange (oklch(0.65 0.2 40)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Card Gray (oklch(0.98 0 0)): Dark text (oklch(0.25 0 0)) - Ratio 13.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should project modern professionalism while maintaining excellent readability across technical and creative content - Inter provides the perfect balance of geometric precision and humanist warmth.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Platform Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Feature Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Interface Text): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Code (Technical Content): JetBrains Mono/13px/monospace precision

## Animations

Animations should feel sophisticated and purposeful, reinforcing the platform's technical precision while adding moments of delight during key interactions like successful deploys.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates system state changes and guides users through complex workflows
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary actions (deploy, save) get prominent animations, secondary actions get subtle transitions

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Dialog for project creation, Card for project grid, Tabs for editor modes, Button variants for different action hierarchies, Form components for authentication, Toast for notifications
- **Customizations**: Custom split-pane editor layout, project status indicators, deploy progress components
- **States**: Buttons show loading states during deploys, inputs provide real-time validation feedback, cards highlight on hover with project previews
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for their technical precision - Code, Globe, Palette, Rocket for core features
- **Spacing**: 8px grid system with generous padding (16px-24px) for professional feel
- **Mobile**: Responsive navigation with collapsible sidebar, stack editor modes vertically, touch-optimized controls
